Since **docassemble** is a web application, for many people the
hardest part about using it is figuring out how to deploy it on the
internet.

The easiest way to deploy **docassemble** is to use [Docassemble
Toolkit], a hosting and support service provided by
[community.lawyer], a Public Benefit Corporation based in Brookyln,
New York.

If you want to deploy **docassemble** yourself, the easiest way is to
install it using [Docker] on whatever machine you wish to use.
[Docker] works on laptop computers as well as on virtual machines in
the cloud (or [clusters] of them).  If you want very fine-grained
control, you can [install] it without using Docker.

Since **docassemble** is free software, there are no fees for using
it, but hosting a server on the internet will cost money (between $10
and $300 per month depending on what your performance, availability,
and support needs are).
