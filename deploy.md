Since **docassemble** is a web application, for many people the
hardest part about using it is figuring out how to deploy it on the
internet.

The easiest way to use **docassemble** is through a
**docassemble**-based third-party service that provides interview
development tools.  Existing providers include [Community.lawyer] and
[Documate].  (A third provider, [Clerical Platform], is currently
available in beta mode.)

If you want to deploy **docassemble** yourself, the easiest way is to
install it using [Docker] on whatever machine you wish to use.
[Docker] works on laptop computers as well as on virtual machines in
the cloud (or [clusters] of them).  Using a cloud-based virtual
machine is recommended.  If you want very fine-grained control, you
can [install] it without using Docker.

If you are interested in hiring someone to develop an interview for
you, you can propose a project in the #questions channel of the [Slack
group].  Consultants who are available for projects include:

* [Lemma Legal Consulting]

Since **docassemble** is free software, there are no fees for using
it, but hosting a server on the internet will cost money (between $10
and $40 per month, or more, depending on what your performance,
availability, and support needs are).
