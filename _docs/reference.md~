## Initial information

### metadata

{% highlight yaml %}
---
metadata:
  description: |
    A divorce advice interview
  authors:
    - name: John Doe
      organization: Example, Inc.
  revision_date: 2015-09-28
---
{% endhighlight %}

A `metadata` block contains information about the YAML file, such as
the name of the author.  May contain any YAML structure.

### objects

{% highlight yaml %}
---
objects:
  - spouse: Individual
  - user.case: Case
---
{% endhighlight %}

An `objects` block creates objects that may be referenced in your
interview.  For example, if your interview references the variable
`spouse`, **docassemble** will find the above `objects` block and
process it.  It will define `spouse` as an instance of the object
class `Individual` and define `user.case` as an instance of the object
class `Case`.

The use of objects in **docassemble** interviews is highly encouraged.
However, the objects you use as variables in your interview YAML files
need to inherit from the class `DAObject`.  Otherwise, **docassemble**
might not be able to find the appopriate code blocks or questions
necessary to define them.  This is because of the way **docassemble**
keeps track of the names of variables.

A code block like this would effectively do the same thing as the
`objects` block above:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
code: |
  spouse = Individual('spouse')
  user.initializeAttribue(name='case', objectType=Case)
---
{% endhighlight %}

This code is more complicated than normal Python code for object
initialization because the full name of the variable needs to be
supplied to the function that creates and initializes the object.  The
base class `DAObject` keeps track of variable names.

Whenever possible, you should use `objects` blocks rather than code to
initialize your objects.  `objects` blocks are clean and readable.

See [objects]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/objects.md) for more information
about how **docassemble** handles objects.




### include

{% highlight yaml %}
---
include:
  - basic-questions.yml
  - docassemble.helloworld:questions.yml
---
{% endhighlight %}

The `include` statement incorporates the questions in another YAML
file, almost as if the contents of the other YAML file appeared in
place of the `include` statement.  Why "almost"?  Because when the
`include`d file is parsed, files referenced within it will be assumed
to be located in the `include`d file's package.  Second, when
**docassemble** looks for a question to provide the answer to a
variable, it first looks

When a filename is provided without a package name, **docassemble**
will look first in the `data/questions` directory of the current
package, and then in the `data/questions` directory of
`docassemble.base`.

You can include question files from other packages by explicitly
referring to their package names.  E.g.,
`docassemble.helloworld:questions.yml` refers to the file
`questions.yml` in the `docassemble/helloworld/data/questions`
directory of that package.

### image sets

{% highlight yaml %}
---
image sets:
  freepik:
    attribution: |
      Icon made by [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik)
    images:
      baby: crawling.svg
      people: users6.svg
      injury: accident3.svg
---
{% endhighlight %}

An "image sets" block defines the names of icons that you can use to
decorate your questions.

The file names refer to files located in the `data/static` directory
of the package in which the YAML file resides.

Since most free icons available on the internet require attribution,
the "image sets" block allows you to specify what attribution text
to use for particular icons.  The web app shows the appropriate
attribution text at the bottom of any page that uses one of the
icons.

### imports

{% highlight yaml %}
---
---
{% endhighlight %}

"imports" loads some Python modules that we will need in the interview.

### terms

{% highlight yaml %}
---
---
{% endhighlight %}

"terms" Sometimes you will use vocabulary that the user may or may not know.
Instead of interrupting the flow of your questions to define every
term, you can define certain vocabulary words, and docassemble will
turn them into hyperlinks wherever they appear.  When the user
clicks on the hyperlink, a popup appears with the word's definition.

### interview help

{% highlight yaml %}
---
interview help:
  heading: How to use this web site
  content: |
    Answer each question.  At the end, you will get a prize.
---
{% endhighlight %}

An "interview help" block adds text to the "Help" page of every question in the
interview.  If the question has help text of its own, the "interview help" will
appear after the question-specific help.


## question

## subquestion

## code


## help

## buttons

## comment



## mandatory

This is the code that directs the flow of the interview.  It
indicates to the system that we need to get to the endpoint
"user_done."  There is a question below that "sets" the variable
"user_done."  Docassemble will ask all the questions necessary to
get the information need to pose that that final question to the
user.

However, if the answer to the question
user_understands_no_attorney_client_relationship is not
"understands," the interview will looks for a question that sets the
variable "user_kicked_out."

"Mandatory" sections like this one are evaluated in the order they appear
in the question file.

## progress

"progress" If docassemble is configured to show a progress bar, the progress bar will
be set to 100% on this question, which is an endpoint question (since the only
options are exiting or restarting).
