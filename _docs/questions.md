title: Question Blocks

In the **docassemble** web app, every screen that a user sees is
generated by a `question` block, which is a section of [YAML] code
that contains a `question` statement.

All blocks in an interview file must either be [initial blocks],
[code blocks], or contain a `question`.

# The `question` statement

{% highlight yaml %}
---
question: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
fields:
  - Velocity: swallow_velocity
---
{% endhighlight %}

By including the above [YAML] block in your interview file, you are
telling **docassemble** that if it ever needs to know the value of
`swallow_velocity`, it should ask the user the question "What is the
airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" and provide the user with an
input box labeled "Velocity" in which the user can type the answer.

In the web app, the text of the `question` will appear in a large font
at the top of the screen.  You can place an icon to the right of the
question using a `decoration` [modifier].

Like most things in **docassemble**, the `question` statement can
contain [Mako] and [Markdown].  For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
question: |
  What is the *airspeed* velocity of an unladen ${ african_or_european }
  swallow?
fields:
  - Velocity: swallow_velocity
---
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, the question will end up looking like:

> What is the *airspeed* velocity of an unladen African swallow?

# The `subquestion` statement

{% highlight yaml %}
---
question: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
subquestion: Be careful how you answer.
fields:
  - Velocity: swallow_velocity
---
{% endhighlight %}

The optional `subquestion` adds text underneath the `question`.  It is
typically used to explain the question in more detail, if such an
explanation is necessary.

# Using questions to set variables

Every `question` block in a **docassemble** interview must have a
purpose.  Otherwise, **docassemble** would never have a reason for
asking the question.  Questions are given a purpose with one of the
following extra statements:

* `yesno` (or its opposite, `noyes`): will set a variable when a Yes
  or No button is pressed.
* `field`: will set a variable when a button is pressed in response to
  a multiple-choice question.
* `fields`: the question will set one or more variables when
"Continue" is pressed.
* `signature`: the user will be asked to sign his or her name, and the
  image will be saved as a variable.
* `sets`: advertises to the interview logic that a variable could
  potentially be set by asking the question.
* `event`: advertises to the interview logic that the question should
  be asked if an special event occurs, such as a user not being able
  to proceed with an interview because the interview logic requires
  information from a person in a different role.

These statements are explained in the next section.
