In the **docassemble** web app, every screen that a user sees is
generated by a [`question`] block, which is a section of [YAML] code
that contains a [`question`] statement.

All blocks in an interview file must either be [initial blocks],
[code blocks], or contain a [`question`].

# <a name="question"></a>The `question` statement

{% include side-by-side.html demo="question" %}

By including the above [YAML] block in your interview file, you are
telling **docassemble** that if it ever needs to know the value of
`swallow_velocity`, it should ask the user the question "What is the
airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" and provide the user with an
input box labeled "Velocity" in which the user can type the answer.

Like most things in **docassemble**, the `question` statement can
contain [Markdown] and [Mako].  For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="question-markup" %}

In this example, the word "airspeed" is italicized, using the
[Markdown] syntax for italics.  The type of swallow is given by a
variable (`african_or_european`), the value of which (`"African"`) is
incorporated using [Mako].  (One of the features of [Mako] is that
anything enclosed in `${ ... }` is evaluated as [Python] code.)

# <a name="subquestion"></a>The `subquestion` statement

The optional `subquestion` adds text underneath the [`question`].  It is
typically used to explain the question in more detail, if such an
explanation is necessary.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="subquestion" %}

# Using questions to set variables

Here is a brief summary of the types of questions that can be asked.
More detail about how these question types work is provided in the
[next section].

## True or false: `yesno` and `noyes`

A [`yesno`] question will set a variable to `True` or `False` when a Yes
or No button is pressed.  [`noyes`] does the opposite.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="yesno" %}

## Multiple choice: `choices` or `buttons`

You can ask a multiple-choice question by providing a list of [`choices`]:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="choices" %}

Or, if you would prefer to use one-click buttons instead of "radio
buttons" in combination with a "Continue" button, use can use
[`buttons`] instead of [`choices`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="buttons" %}

The variable indicated by [`field`] will be set to the value supplied in
the [`choices`]/[`buttons`] list.

## Acknowledgement button: `field`

If you simply want the user to acknowledge something by clicking
"Continue," provide a [`field`] without [`buttons`] or [`choices`].

The variable indicated by [`field`] will be set to `True` when the user
clicks "Continue."

{% include side-by-side.html demo="continue" %}

## One or more fill-in fields: [`fields`]

You can ask the user to fill in multiple fields using [`fields`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="text-field" %}

There are many other types of input that you can gather with [`fields`],
including large text areas, file uploads, radio buttons, and
checkboxes.

There are a variety of ways you can insert text into the list of
fields to help guide the user.  If you know [HTML], you can insert
arbitrary [HTML], [CSS], and [Javascript].

## User's signature: `signature`

You can ask the user to write his or her signature using [`signature`]:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="signature" %}

The signature will be stored as an image file in the variable
indicated by [`signature`].

## <a name="ending screens"></a>Ending screens

Sometimes, the purpose of your [`question`] is not to gather
information but to present an end screen to the user.  You can create
such "questions" by marking them as [`mandatory`]:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="terminal-screen" %}

If you have more than one possible ending screen in your interview,
use the [`event`](#event) feature described below.

## <a name="event"></a>Special screens: `event`

Some screens are shown to the user when a special event occurs.

For example, if you have a [multi-user interview] and the interview
reaches a point where the user cannot proceed until the other
interviewee answers a question, the user will see a [`question`] that
explains why he or she needs to wait.

Or, you might want to provide the user with the ability to review his
or her answers on a single screen, using the [`review`] functionality.

The [`event`] directive advertises to the interview logic that the
question should be asked if an special event occurs.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="event-example" %}

This directive can be used to indicate an
[ending screen](#ending screens), where your interview has more than
one possible ending screen and you use [interview logic] to direct the
user to the appropriate screen.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="doors" %}

In this example, `good_luck` and `bad_luck` are actually names of
[Python] variables.  However, they are [Python] variables that will
never be defined.  If a reference to these variables is made, as it is
in the [`mandatory`] [`code`] block, **docassemble** will locate the
`good_luck` and `bad_luck` questions, just as it looks for questions
that offer to define any variable.

See [interview logic] for more information about how to
give direction to your interview by adding [`code`] blocks that are
marked with the [`mandatory`] modifier.

The `event` directive is also used to create screens that the user can
reach from the menu or from hyperlinks embedded in question text.  For
more information, see [`event`], [`url_action()`],
[`process_action()`], [`action_menu_item()`], and [`menu_items`].

## <a name="sets special"></a>Adding action buttons to a "terminal" screen

The `sets` statement is also used in conjunction with `buttons` in
multiple choice questions where there is no `field` to be set.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="sets-exit" %}

The above example allows the user to "exit" the interview (be redirected
to a specific web site that is pre-set in the **docassemble**
[configuration] or "restart" the interview (go back to the beginning).

There are six special button functions:

* `restart`
* `exit`
* `leave`
* `continue`
* `refresh`
* `signin`

`restart` resets the user's variable store, except that any parameters
that were originally passed through as URL parameters will be used again.

`exit` means that the user's variable store will be reset and the user
will be redirected either to the URL given by the associated `url`
text, or if no `url` is defined, to the `exit` page defined in the
[configuration].  If the user tries to come back to the interview
again, he will start the interview again, as though it had never been
started.  Original URL parameters will be lost.

For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="sets-exit-url" %}

[Mako] can be used in the `url` text.

`leave` works like `exit` except that the user's variable store will be left
intact.  This means that if the user comes back to the interview
again, he will pick up where he left off.

`continue` means that **docassemble** will look for another question
in the interview that might define the necessary variable.

`refresh` re-runs the [interview logic].  It has much the same effect as
refreshing the page in the browser.  It is useful in multi-user
interviews when the user is waiting for another user to finish
entering information.  It can also be useful in interviews that use
external data sources.

`signin` redirects the user to the **docassemble** sign-in page.

Instead of using `buttons`, you can use `choices` to get a radio list
instead of a selection of buttons.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="sets-exit-choices" %}

The functionality is the same.
