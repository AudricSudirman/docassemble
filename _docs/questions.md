In the **docassemble** web app, every screen that a user sees is
generated by a [`question`] block, which is a section of [YAML] code
that contains a [`question`] statement.

All blocks in an interview file must either be [initial blocks],
[code blocks], or contain a [`question`].

# <a name="question"></a>The `question` statement

{% include side-by-side.html demo="question" %}

By including the above [YAML] block in your interview file, you are
telling **docassemble** that if it ever needs to know the value of
`swallow_velocity`, it should ask the user the question "What is the
airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?" and provide the user with an
input box labeled "Velocity" in which the user can type the answer.

Like most things in **docassemble**, the `question` statement can
contain [Markdown] and [Mako].  For example:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="question-markup" %}

In this example, the word "airspeed" is italicized, using the
[Markdown] syntax for italics.  The type of swallow is given by a
variable (`african_or_european`), the value of which (`"African"`) is
incorporated using [Mako].  (One of the features of [Mako] is that
anything enclosed in `${ ... }` is evaluated as [Python] code.)

# The `subquestion` statement

The optional `subquestion` adds text underneath the [`question`].  It is
typically used to explain the question in more detail, if such an
explanation is necessary.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="subquestion" %}

# Using questions to set variables

Every [`question`] block in a **docassemble** interview must have a
purpose.  Otherwise, **docassemble** would never have a reason for
asking the question.  Questions are given a purpose by adding an extra
statement, like [`fields`] in the example above.

Here is a brief summary of the types of questions that can be asked.
More detail about how these question types work is provided in the
[next section].

## True or false: `yesno` and `noyes`

A [`yesno`] question will set a variable to `True` or `False` when a Yes
or No button is pressed.  [`noyes`] does the opposite.

{% include side-by-side.html demo="yesno" %}

## Multiple choice: `choices` or `buttons`

You can ask a multiple-choice question by providing a list of [`choices`]:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="choices" %}

Or, if you would prefer to use one-click buttons instead of "radio
buttons" in combination with a "Continue" button, use can use
[`buttons`] instead of [`choices`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="buttons" %}

The variable indicated by [`field`] will be set to the value supplied in
the [`choices`]/[`buttons`] list.

## Acknowledgement button: `field`

If you simply want the user to acknowledge something by clicking
"Continue," provide a [`field`] without [`buttons`] or [`choices`].

The variable indicated by [`field`] will be set to `True` when the user
clicks "Continue."

{% include side-by-side.html demo="continue" %}

## One or more fill-in fields: [`fields`]

You can ask the user to fill in multiple fields using [`fields`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="text-field" %}

There are many other types of input that you can gather with [`fields`],
including large text areas, file uploads, radio buttons, and
checkboxes.

There are a variety of ways you can insert text into the list of
fields to help guide the user.  If you know [HTML], you can insert
arbitrary [HTML], [CSS], and [Javascript].

## User's signature: `signature`

You can ask the user to write his or her signature using [`signature`]:

{% include side-by-side.html demo="signature" %}

The signature will be stored as an image file in the variable
indicated by [`signature`].

## Ending screens: `sets`

If the purpose of your [`question`] is not to ask a question but to
present an end screen to the user, use [`sets`].

{% include side-by-side.html demo="sets" %}

If **docassemble** needs the variable `all_done`, it will present this
"question" to the user.  See the [interview logic] section for more
information about how to tell **docassemble** which ending screens the
interview should endeavor to reach.

## Special screens: `event` (advanced)

The [`event`] directive advertises to the interview logic that the
question should be asked if an special event occurs, such as a user
not being able to proceed with an interview because the interview
logic requires information from a person in a different [role].

This directive is also used to create screens that the user can reach
from the menu or from hyperlinks embedded in question text.  For more
information, see [`event`], [`url_action()`], [`process_action()`],
[`action_menu_item()`], and [`menu_items`].
