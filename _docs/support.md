# Slack

To get help from the community of developers and other users, join the
[**docassemble** Slack group].  If you would prefer not to ask a
question to the group, you can [e-mail the developer].

# Mailing list

It is also a good idea to join the [docassemble mailing list].  The
mailing list is much less active than the [Slack] group, but it will
allow you to receive important announcements if you don't check the
[Slack group] every day.

# Help with deployment and development

If deploying a web app and writing "code" are barriers, there are
[third party providers] who provide platforms based on **docassemble**
and offer "no code" tools for deployment and development.

# Tutorials

[![flowchart](https://gblsma.github.io/docassemble-MotionTutorial/images/docassemble-workflow.png){: .maybe-full-width }](https://gblsma.github.io/docassemble-MotionTutorial/)

[Quinten Steenhuis] and Rina Padua of [Greater Boston Legal Services]
developed [a tutorial on developing an interview that automates a Word
document to create a motion to
dismiss](https://gblsma.github.io/docassemble-MotionTutorial/).
Quinten has also written an article on [Object-oriented Programming
for Document Assembly Developers].

# Video guides

This video by [John Gibson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8iZ3ft6Ipg4IYdQtEUtiZw)

Azure] and running an interview that accesses a SQL server.

# Bugs 

If you find a bug, please [submit an issue on GitHub].  Keep in mind
that not all error messages represent bugs; it might be the case that
you misconfigured your system or you have a mistake in your code.  It
is a good idea to ask a question about the error message first.
