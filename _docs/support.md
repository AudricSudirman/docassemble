# Slack

To get help from the community of developers and other users, join the
[**docassemble** Slack group].  If you would prefer not to ask a
question to the group, you can [e-mail the developer].

# Mailing list

It is also a good idea to join the [docassemble mailing list].  The
mailing list is much less active than the [Slack] group, but it will
allow you to receive important announcements if you don't check the
[Slack group] every day.

# Training

In-person training will be available at [Docacon 2018], a one-day
**docassemble** conference to be held on June 22, 2018 in Chicago,
Illinois.

# Video guides

This video by [John Gibson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8iZ3ft6Ipg4IYdQtEUtiZw)
walks through the process of installing **docassemble** on [Microsoft
Azure] and running an interview that accesses a SQL server.

# Bugs 

If you find a bug, please [submit an issue on GitHub].  Keep in mind
that not all error messages represent bugs; it might be the case that
you misconfigured your system or you have a mistake in your code.  It
is a good idea to ask a question about the error message first.
