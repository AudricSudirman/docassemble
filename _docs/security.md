**docassemble** is designed with user privacy in mind.

# Security features

## <a name="server_encryption"></a>Server-side information storage

User passwords and interview answers are stored in a SQL database in
encrypted form, unless the [`multi_user`] variable is set to `True`,
in which case the answers are not encrypted.

If users log in with [external authentication methods] or the
[phone login] feature, interview answers are still encrypted (unless
the [`multi_user`] variable is set to `True`), but a resourceful
hacker could figure out the encryption key.  Therefore, if server-side
encryption is important to you, it is recommended that you do not
enable [external authentication methods] or the [phone login] feature.

Uploaded and assembled documents are stored on the server (and on
[Amazon S3], if [S3] is being used, or [Microsoft Azure], if
[Azure blob storage] is being used) without encryption.  These
documents cannot be accessed from the internet without an appropriate
access key in the cookie.

When a user clicks an "Exit" button, **docassemble** will delete all of
the information related to the interview from the server, including
the database, uploaded documents, and assembled documents.  However,
temporary files in /tmp will persist until cleaned out by a cron job.

## Sign-in security

**docassemble** blocks brute-force password-guessing attacks.

**docassemble** also supports [two-factor authentication].

By default, users do not need to verify their e-mail addresses, but
you can require them to do so.  See the documentation for the
[`email confirmation privileges`] configuration directive.

# Importance of using HTTPS

It is important for security purposes to deploy **docassemble** using
HTTPS rather than HTTP.  If you use HTTP, passwords and security keys
will be sent over the network in plain text.

# Separate development and production servers

Users with "developer" access can run arbitrary code on the server.
For this reason, it is recommended that you not allow developer
accounts on production servers, and that you only install
**docassemble** add-on packages that you have carefully reviewed.

# Avoiding sharing session keys

Each session of a **docassemble** interview is uniquely identified by
a session key, which is a series of randomly-generated characters.  If
server-side encryption is turned off (by setting [`multi_user`] to
`True`), then anyone who possesses the encryption key can access the
interview session.  Thus there is a risk to e-mailing a user a link to
an interview generated by [`interview_url()`], since the URL will
contain the session key.  This URL is like the URL to a Google Docs
file where "anyone with the link can edit."  You can mitigate this
risk somewhat by using the `temporary` keyword argument or the
`once_temporary` keyword argument to [`interview_url()`].  Then, the
link that you share will not contain the actual interview session key,
and the link will expire after a period of time.

# Security in multi-user interviews

If you have a [multi-user interview], you will set [`multi_user`] to
`True` in order to turn off server-side encryption.  Then anyone with
the session key can access a session.

In the ordinary course of a [multi-user interview], each user will
only see the screens your interview expects them to see.  For example,
you could design a divorce mediation interview in which two parties to
a divorce each share confidential information into the same session,
and one spouse will not be able to see information entered by the
other spouse.

However, **docassemble**'s [front end interface] is designed to be
open and flexible, so that developers have the freedom to innovate.
By default, the [JavaScript] function [`get_interview_variables()`] is
available, which will retrieve all of the interview answers in [JSON]
format from the server.

If one of the users who has access to the session key is not fully
trusted, you may worry that they will teach themselves how
**docassemble** works and take steps to "snoop around" in the
interview and access information they shouldn't, for example by
running [`get_interview_variables()`] in the [JavaScript] console or
visiting the `/vars` page (which is called by
[`get_interview_variables()`] to obtain a [JSON] version of the
interview answers for the current session).

You can take steps to "harden" your interview against such
unauthorized snooping.  You can include the following at the beginning
of your interview:

{% highlight yaml %}
mandatory: True
code: |
  set_status(variable_access=False)
{% endhighlight %}

This will disable the [`get_interview_variables()`] feature.

Another way that a user could snoop around is by using
the [JavaScript] function [`url_action()`] to access screens they are
not supposed to see.  For example, if your two users are represented
by two [`Individual`]s in your interview answers called `petitioner`
and `respondent`, the respondent might try to call
[`url_action("petitioner.ssn")`] from the [JavaScript] console.


# Issues to look out for

**docassemble** makes extensive use of [eval] and [exec], including to
process information supplied by the user.  There are protections in
place to prevent code injection, but more work could be done to harden
**docassemble** against such threats.

The options for allowing users to log in with Google, Facebook,
Twitter, Azure, and mobile phone numbers are provided for convenience,
but you may wish not to enable these features because the encryption
of interview answers on the server is less effective when users log in
without a password.  This is because the password is used as the
encryption key, which is advantageous because it is not stored
anywhere on the server; the user remembers it and it is stored in a
cookie in the user's browser.  When users log in with something other
than a password, however, there is no such key available.  As a
result, the key for encrypting user answers on the server is
constructed based on information that is stored on the server.  As a
result, an intruder with access to the server could reverse-engineer
the encrpytion key for an interview belonging to a user who logs in
with something other than a password.

On [Docker], **docassemble** installs [npm] from a [different source]
because [npm] is missing from [Debian stretch] due to unresolved
security issues in a Javascript library.  The installation of [npm]
may have security implications.  However, the only Javascript-based
application that **docassemble** uses is [`azure-storage-cmd`], and
this is only used when [Azure blob storage] is enabled.
