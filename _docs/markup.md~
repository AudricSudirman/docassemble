**docassemble** allows you to format your text using [Markdown] and
use [Mako] to make your documents "smart."

## Markdown

The syntax of [Markdown] is explained well
[elsewhere](http://www.makotemplates.org/).

Here are some examples of things you can do with Markdown:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
question: |
  This is *italic text*.
  This is **bold text**.
  This is __also bold text__.
  This is _underlined text_.

  > This is some block-quoted
  > text

  ### This is a heading

  Here is a bullet list:

  * Apple
  * Peach
  * Pear

  Here is a numbered list:

  1. Nutmeg
  2. Celery
  3. Oregano

  This is equivalent to the above:

  #. Nutmeg
  #. Celery
  #. Oregano

fields:
  - Velocity: swallow_velocity
