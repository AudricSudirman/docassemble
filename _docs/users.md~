**docassemble** has a built-in username and password system.  Users
can click "Log in" in the upper-right-hand corner to log in, and if
they do not have a username and password on the system, they can
register.

End users who are not logged in will lose their session information if
they close their web browser.  If they register and log in, however,
they can fill out part of an interview, close the web browser, log
back in again, and pick up where they left off.

When a user registers in the **docassemble** system, their default
"role" is that of "user," which has the lowest privileges.  There are
four user roles defined by default in **docassemble**:
* user
* admin
* developer
* advocate


A user who is an administrator can upgrade
the role of any user
