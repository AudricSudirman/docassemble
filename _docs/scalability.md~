short_title: Scalability

**docassemble** is easily scalable.  It does not store any user
information in memory or in an in-memory cache.  Rather, it uses a SQL
database to store user answers and a filesystem to store user
documents.  As a result, a cluster of servers configured to point to
the same SQL database and mounting the same filesystem can serve
responses to client browsers.

Each server's configuration is defined in `/etc/docassemble/config.yml`.
The default SQL configuration is:

	db:
	  prefix: postgresql+psycopg2://
	  name: docassemble
	  user: null
	  password: null
	  host: null
	  port: null

This assumes a PostgreSQL database called "docassemble"
