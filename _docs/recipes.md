# Require a checkbox to be checked

## Using `validation code`

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.base.util
---
question: |
  You must agree to the terms of service.
fields:
  - I agree to the terms of service: agrees_to_tos
    datatype: yesnowide
validation code: |
  if not agrees_to_tos:
    validation_error("You cannot continue until you agree to the terms of service.")
---
mandatory: True
need: agrees_to_tos
question: All done.
{% endhighlight %}

## Using `datatype: checkboxes`

{% highlight yaml %}
question: |
  You must agree to the terms of service.
fields:
  - no label: agrees_to_tos
    datatype: checkboxes
    minlength: 1
    choices:
      - I agree to the terms of service
    validation messages:
      minlength: |
        You cannot continue unless you check this checkbox.

# Use a variable to track when an interview has been completed

One way to track whether an interview is completed is to set a
variable when the interview is done.  That way, you can inspect the
interview answers and test for the presence of this variable.

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.base.util
---
objects:
  - user: Individual
---
question: |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - First name: user.name.first
  - Last name: user.name.last
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  user.name.first
  user_finish_time
  final_screen
---
code: |
  user_finish_time = current_datetime()
---
event: final_screen
question: |
  Goodbye, user!
buttons:
  Exit: exit
{% endhighlight %}

You could also use Redis to store the status of an interview.

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
  - docassemble.base.util
---
objects:
  - user: Individual
  - r: DARedis
---
question: |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - First name: user.name.first
  - Last name: user.name.last
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  interview_marked_as_started
  user.name.first
  interview_marked_as_finished
  final_screen
---
code: |
  redis_key = user_info().filename + ':' + user_info().session
---
code: |
  r.set(redis_key, 'started')
  interview_marked_as_started = True
---
code: |
  r.set(redis_key, 'finished')
  interview_marked_as_finished = True
---
event: final_screen
question: |
  Goodbye, user!
buttons:
  Exit: exit
{% endhighlight %}
