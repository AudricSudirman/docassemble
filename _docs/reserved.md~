title: Reserved Variable Names
short_title: Reserved Names
---

The following variables are set internally by **docassemble**.  If you
try to use these reserved names as variable names, you will experience
errors or unexpected results.

* `_internal`: used internally by **docassemble** for various
  purposes, including keeping track of the progress bar, storing the
  answers to multiple-choice questions, and tracking which questions
  have already been answered.
* `current_info`: a dictionary available to the interview code that
  contains some useful information about the interview and the current
  user.  It is pre-set by **docassemble** on every page load.
* `i`: used as an iterator when [generic objects] are defined.
* `role`: used to store the role of the current user for purposes of
  the [roles] system.
* `url_args`: a dictionary available to interview code that contains
  values encoded in the URL with which the interview was initially
  loaded.
* `x`: used as a reference to the underlying object when
  [generic objects] are defined.

the list of reserved names expands to the following:
