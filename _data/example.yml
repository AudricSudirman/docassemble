  \   Four score and seven years ago\n      our fathers brought forth on\n      this\

  \ that\n      nation, or any nation so\n      conceived and so dedicated,\n    \
  \  can long endure.\n\n      [PAGEBREAK]\n\n      Now we begin a new[EMDASH]and\n\
  \      very exciting[EMDASH]page.\n\n      We dare not forget today that\n     \
  \ we are the heirs of that first\n      revolution. Let the word go\n      forth\
  \ from this time and place,\n      to friend and foe alike, that\n      the torch\
  \ has been passed to\n      a new generation of\n      Americans [ENDASH] born in\
  \ this\n      century, tempered by war,\n      disciplined by a hard and\n     \
  \ bitter peace, proud of our\n      ancient heritage, and unwilling\n      to witness\
  \ or permit the slow\n      undoing of those human rights\n      to which this nation\
  \ has\n      always been committed, and to\n      which we are committed today\n\
  \      at home and around the world.\n\n      And yet our distress comes from\n\
  \      no failure of substance. We are\n      stricken by no plague of locusts.\n\
  \      Compared with the perils which\n      our forefathers conquered,\n      because\
  \ they believed and were\n      not afraid, we have still much\n      to be thankful\
  \ for. Nature still\n      offers her bounty and human\n      efforts have multiplied\

  \ details. I believe we've\n      had enough of that in the\n      United States,\
  \ particularly with\n      the present Administration in\n      Washington, D.C.\
  \ To me the\n      office of the Vice Presidency\n      of the United States is\
  \ a great\n      office, and I feel that the\n      people have got to have\n  \

        Four score and seven years ago
        our fathers brought forth on
        this continent, a new nation,
        conceived in Liberty, and
        dedicated to the proposition
        that all men are created equal.

        Now we are engaged in a great
        civil war, testing whether that
        nation, or any nation so
        conceived and so dedicated,
        can long endure.

        # What about double-spacing?

        Let's try this with double
        spacing.
