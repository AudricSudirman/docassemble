# What is docassemble?

**docassemble** is a free, open-source expert system for guided
interviews and document assembly.  It provides a web site that
conducts interviews with users.  Based on the information gathered,
the interviews can present users with documents in [PDF], [RTF], or
[DOCX] format, which users can download or e-mail.

Though the name emphasizes the document assembly feature,
**docassemble** interviews do not need to assemble a document; they
might submit an application, direct the user to other resources on the
internet, [store] user input, interact with [APIs], or simply provide the user with
information.

**docassemble** was created by a [lawyer/computer programmer] for
purposes of automating the practice of law, but it is a
general-purpose platform that can find applications in a variety of
fields.
