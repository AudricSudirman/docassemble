**docassemble** is expected to continue to be maintained so long as
there is interest in using it.

## Risks

### Loss of main developer

To date, the vast majority of the work on **docassemble** has been
undertaken by the lead developer, Jonathan Pyle.  If Jonathan Pyle
were to be longer able to maintain **docassemble**, there would be a
risk that **docassemble** would no longer be maintained.

There are reasons to expect that **docassemble** would continue to be
maintained in the absence of the lead developer.  Since the
**docassemble** source code is available in its entirety on GitHub,
anyone in the world could step in and maintain it at any time.  It is
possible that someone would maintain it because:

* Software developers have contributed pull requests in the past.
* Documate and Community.lawyer use it.
* Large law firms and corporations use it.
* The non-profit Merlin Legal Open Source Foundation could receive and
  distribute funds for the continued development of **docassemble**.
